I am a Software Engineer based in Karachi, Pakistan. I started my programming life from native Android development but quickly realized the beauty and power of Javascript cross platform technologies. Since then I have been working with Node.js. I recently discovered the brilliance of single page applications and how easily Angular JS helps us design SPAs in little time and now I am exploring the depths of what goes inside the browser with Angular JS.

They call me a cricket fanatic, a PS3 enthusiast and one who can give up food and sleep for a game of Dota.

I am currently employed at 10Pearls, Karachi and I am a BS(CS) graduate from IBA, Karachi.
