<p>I came across a problem today in which I had to enable some options (which are disabled on page load) once the text area/div which has a scroll attached to it has reached the end. Usually such are the requirements when you want the user to scroll through or read the complete text before he can continue with whatever hes doing. Since it might become a requirement for other projects as well, I decided to wrap it up inside a small and neat directive. Here is how to use it:</p>
<p><a href="/assets/b2one1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-22" src="/assets/b2one1.png" alt="Using ukScroll directive in view" width="676" height="67" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#464646;">*By setting a variable, I mean setting it to a value </span><strong style="color:#464646;">true</strong><span style="color:#464646;">.</span><br style="color:#464646;" /><br style="color:#464646;" /><span style="color:#464646;">There are 2 simple steps to accomplish setting a variable from the directives parent scope once the scroll has reached its end:</span></p>
<ol style="color:#464646;">
<li>Place a<strong> uk-scroll</strong> directive on the textarea/div. This would place a scroll listener on the tag with the required logic.</li>
<li>Provide the <strong>uk-scroll</strong> directive with a variable on the scope to set via the <strong>set-on-scroll-complete </strong>attribute.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color:#464646;">Once the scroll has reached its end, the value of the variable on the scope, which is in the above case, </span><strong style="color:#464646;">"radBtn"</strong><span style="color:#464646;"> would be set i.e. </span><strong style="color:#464646;">"radBtn = true"</strong><br style="color:#464646;" /><br style="color:#464646;" /><br style="color:#464646;" /><span style="color:#464646;">Here is how the directive source looks like:</span></p>
<p><a href="/assets/b2two1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-23" src="/assets/b2two1.png" alt="ukScroll Directive Source" width="611" height="308" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#464646;">Hope this might come in handy. Keep the suggestions/recommendations coming in.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#464646;">Source code can be found <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="https://github.com/mohammadumairkhan/ukScroll" target="_blank">here</a>.</span></span></p>
