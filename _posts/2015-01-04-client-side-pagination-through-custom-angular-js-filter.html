<p>Angular JS is a powerful front-end framework and often I have tried and successfully delegated it responsibilities for which I might have written a good chunk of code on the server back-end. One such instance was pagination. If you are not familiar, pagination is a technique through which we present tabular data to the user by breaking it into pages.</p>
<p>In one of my projects, I encountered a use-case in which the size of the records coming in was not very very huge. I wanted to paginate the records to enhance the user experience and making round trips to the server to fetch each page felt like forever. It is then I decided to completely handover my pagination responsibilities to the front-end.</p>
<p>I could have done everything I needed to paginate the records on the controller with <b><i>Loadash</i></b> doing all the heavy lifting and filtering for me, but I felt guilty. It felt like treason to write something that “un-re-useable”. <em>Beautiful software is not complex, it is simple. </em> So, I wanted to create a custom filter in Angular JS which would filter out the records for me and all I needed to do was to give it suitable parameters through my view. And then I can use the “all-famous” UI-Bootstrap controls for pagination to show the user what page are you on, how many pages are there altogether etc.</p>
<p>The bird’s eye view of the filter function was:</p>
<p><b>Input:</b> 1) Complete list of records, 2) Requested page number (we will call this current page) and 3) Records per page</p>
<p><b>Output: </b>List of records for the requested page</p>
<p>Here is how simple and tiny the filter came out to be …</p>

<p>Its usage is even simpler.</p>
<p>Hook it up as a filter to the <b><i>ng-repeat </i></b>expression as follows and it would to all the pagination stuff for you.</p>

<p>Pretty simple huh ?</p>
<p>Its complete source can be found in <a title="kuAngular" href="https://github.com/mohammadumairkhan/kuangular" target="_blank">this</a> little github repository. Just clone the it and open up “index.html” and browse to the pagination demo.</p>
